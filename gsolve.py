"""Solve for imaging system response function.

 Given a set of pixel values observed for several pixels in several
 images with different exposure times, this function returns the
 imaging systemâ€™s response function g as well as the log film irradiance
 values for the observed pixels.

 Assumes:

 Zmin = 0
 Zmax = 255

 Arguments:

 Z(i,j) is the pixel values of pixel location number i in image j
 B(j) is the log delta t, or log shutter speed, for image j
 l is lamdba, the constant that determines the amount of smoothness
 w(z) is the weighting function value for pixel value z

 Returns:

 g(z) is the log exposure corresponding to pixel value z
 lE(i) is the log film irradiance at pixel location i
